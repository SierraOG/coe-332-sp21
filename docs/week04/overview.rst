Week 4: Advanced Containers, YAML, Docker Compose
=================================================

In this fourth week of class, we will dive deeper into Docker containers by
building our own and pushing them to Docker Hub (please make sure you have a
`Docker Hub account <https://hub.docker.com/signup>`_). We will also take a look
at the YAML language which is commonly used for container orchestration.

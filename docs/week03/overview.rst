Week 3: Version Control, Intro to Containers
============================================

In this third week of class, we will familiarize ourselves with version control
by working with Git and GitHub. We will also see our first introduction to
containers through Docker and Docker Hub.

If you don't have them already, please create accounts on
`GitHub <https://github.com/join>`_
and
`Docker Hub <https://hub.docker.com/signup>`_,
both of which we will use extensively in this class. (You can use existing
personal accounts, or if you prefer you can make new accounts specifically for
this class).

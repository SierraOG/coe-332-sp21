Week 6: Intro to APIs, Intro to Flask
=====================================

In this sixth week of class, we will be introduced to Application Programming
Interfaces (APIs). This introduction will form the foundation of our ultimate
goal to create large, complex, python-based applications that are accessible
through the web. The particular REST API framework we will be working with most
is called Flask.
